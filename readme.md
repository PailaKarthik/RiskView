## 🚨 The Problem

When traveling to unfamiliar places, most people are completely unaware of:

| ⚠️ Risk Type | Description |
|---|---|
| 🎭 **Common Scams** | Tourist traps, fake services, and deceptive schemes |
| 🏚️ **Unsafe Areas** | Neighborhoods with elevated crime or danger |
| 🚗 **Dangerous Roads** | Hazardous routes and traffic black spots |
| 👁️ **Suspicious Activity** | Local threats that aren't covered by guidebooks |

> 💬 *Most travel apps prioritize attractions and restaurants — not your **safety**.*
> RiskView was built to change that.

---

## 💡 The Solution

RiskView provides a **community-driven safety platform** where every traveler becomes a contributor to a shared safety network.

<div align="center">

```
👤 Travelers Report  →  📍 Map Displays Risks  →  🤖 AI Analyzes Data  →  🔔 You Stay Safe
```

</div>

**With RiskView, you can:**

- 🗺️ View nearby safety reports pinned on a live map
- 📝 Submit reports about scams or dangerous situations you encounter
- 👍 Vote on reports to surface the most reliable warnings
- 🔔 Receive automatic alerts when entering risky zones
- 🤖 Get AI-generated summaries of local safety conditions
- ❓ Ask natural language questions like *"Is this area safe at night?"*

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 📍 Location-Based Reports
> See what's happening around you — right now.

Reports are displayed on an interactive map based on your current location. Each pin represents a real incident reported by a fellow traveler, covering:
- 🎭 Scams & fraud
- ⚠️ Dangerous zones
- 🚨 Active safety issues

---

### 📣 Community Reporting
> Your experience protects the next traveler.

Submit detailed incident reports with:

```
📌 Location       →  Exact coordinates of the incident
🏷️ Category       →  Scam or Danger
📋 Title          →  Short summary of the event
📄 Description    →  Full account of what happened
```

---

### 🗳️ Voting System
> Crowd-sourced reliability filtering.

Every report can be **upvoted ✅** or **downvoted ❌** by the community.  
This surfaces trustworthy reports and buries inaccurate ones — keeping the platform reliable.

---

### 🚗 Travel Mode
> Hands-free, continuous safety monitoring.

Enable Travel Mode and RiskView watches your back automatically:

- 🔄 Fetches nearby reports **every 30 seconds**
- 🔔 Sends **push notifications** when multiple hazards are detected nearby
- 📡 Works in the background while you explore

---

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Safety Insights

Powered by **LangChain + Groq LLM (`meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`)**

#### 🔍 Category Validation
AI cross-checks whether your report's description actually matches your chosen category — reducing noise and improving data quality.

#### 📊 Safety Summary
Generate an instant AI-written briefing of all nearby incidents. Get the big picture in seconds before stepping into unfamiliar territory.

#### 💬 RAG Question System
Ask anything about a location:
```
"Are there any scams near this market?"
"Is it safe to walk here at night?"
"What should I watch out for in this area?"
```
The AI retrieves relevant nearby reports and crafts a **context-aware answer** just for you.

---

### 🆘 Emergency Assistance
> Help is always one tap away.

The map surfaces **nearby emergency services** including:

- 🏥 Hospitals
- 🚔 Police Stations

Quick-access emergency contacts are always visible when you need them most.

---
